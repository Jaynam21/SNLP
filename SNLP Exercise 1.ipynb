I opened one with trepidation but no need: actually a healthy light colour and a lovely, fresh, tar and roses Barolo nose.

Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking.   ***\n",
      "I have oscillated a bit about this 100% Gargenega wine.   It is Ca Rugate's interpretation of what old Soave might have been like, I seem to recall.   It has a deep colour (from skin contact, I think) and a broad, flat, mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose. It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction: Massa Vecchia and Gravner.   It is rather less grand than either (and a bit cheaper)  but I like it, and I think time is making it more interesting. ***\n",

The 4,274-kilometre (2,656 mi) race consisted of 22 stages, including two split stages, starting in Nancy on 24 June and finishing at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 15 July. There were four time trial stages and no rest days. After more than 30 years, the Tour was again contested by trade teams instead of national teams. Jacques Anquetil of the Saint-Raphaël–Helyett–Hutchinson team won the overall general classification, defending his title to win his third Tour de France. Jef Planckaert (Flandria–Faema–Clément) placed second, 4 min 59 s in arrears, and Raymond Poulidor (Mercier–BP–Hutchinson) was third, over ten minutes behind Anquetil.'''\n",
